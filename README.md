## Aim: 
- To explore various prompting techniques for generating audio using AI models. 
- The goal is to understand how different types of prompts influence the generation of audio, such as music, sound effects, or speech, and how to optimize these prompts for specific needs.

## Instructions:
1. **Choose an Audio Generation Tool:** Select a suitable AI-based audio generation tool (e.g., OpenAI’s Jukedeck, Google’s MusicLM, etc.).
2. **Create Basic and Advanced Prompts:** Start with basic prompts and gradually increase the complexity by adding more context and details.
3. **Experiment with Various Inputs:** Experiment with prompts for different audio types like music, sound effects, and speech.
4. **Listen to the Output:** After generating the audio, assess the quality and appropriateness of the output for the given prompt.
5. **Iterate and Optimize:** Modify the prompts to enhance the audio generation process, exploring what works best for your needs.

## Deliverables:
1. **Set of Prompts:** A collection of different prompts ranging from simple to complex for generating audio.
2. **Generated Audio Outputs:** Samples of generated audio (music, sound effects, or speech) based on the prompts.
3. **Observations and Insights:** Notes on how different prompt designs affect the generated audio (e.g., clarity, mood, tempo, quality).
4. **Optimization Report:** A report summarizing the best prompting techniques for generating specific types of audio (e.g., music, sound effects).

## Procedure:
### 1. Understanding the Basics of Audio Generation with AI:
- Familiarize yourself with AI audio tools like:
- Google MusicLM, Beatoven: Text-to-music generation.
- Jukedeck: Music generation (now integrated into TikTok).
- OpenAI's tools: Versatile for text-to-sound or text-to-speech tasks.
- ElevenLabs: Advanced voice synthesis.
- Boomy: Create personalized music easily.
- Mix Audio: For multimodal audio generation.<br><br>
**Core Concept:**<br>
These tools respond to textual prompts, audio examples, or a combination.
Outputs are shaped by the clarity and specificity of the input.


### 2. Types of Prompts and Their Influence for Audio Generation:
**A. Music Generation**<br><br>
**Naive Prompt:**
```
"Generate soft guitar music."
```
**Likely output:** Generic, non-specific calming music.<br>
**Output:**
<video controls src="Screen Recording 2024-11-20 214609.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

**Refined Prompt:**
```
"Generate a 2-minute soft acoustic music for studying, keep the theme in lo-fi and add a slow tempo (around 60 BPM)"
```
**Likely output:** A focused acoustic beat with specific lo-fi tones and timing.<br>
**Output:**
<video controls src="Audio2.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

**B. Speech or Voice Generation**<br><br>
**Naive Prompt:**
```
"Generate a voice reading a script."
```
**Likely output:** Robotic or general delivery with a standard accent.<br>
**Output:**
<video controls src="20241120-1638-43.1489227.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

**Refined Prompt:**
```
"Generate a enthusiatic and friendly male voice with an American accent reading the script below for a podcast introduction for a news channel. Maintain a professional yet approachable tone.

Script: 
Welcome to "Are You Sure?" the podcast that takes a second look at the headlines. We're here to dig deeper, question the narratives, and separate fact from fiction. Because in today's world of clickbait and misinformation, it's easy to get lost in the noise. Join us as we break down the news, challenge the status quo, and give you the tools to think critically. So, the next time you hear a shocking headline, pause, take a breath, and ask yourself, "Are you sure?""
```

**Likely output:** A tailored voiceover with an approachable and friendly accent for a podcast from a news channel.<br>

**Output:**
<video controls src="20241120-1643-30.9861144.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

**C. Sound Effects**<br><br>
**Naive Prompt:**
```
"Generate rain sounds."
```
**Likely output:** General rain noises, may not sound accurate or upto expectation.<br>
**Output:**
<video controls src="20241120-1648-42.7916271.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

**Refined Prompt:**
```
"Generate a 30-second loop of soft rain sounds with no storms heard from a closed room with gentle waves, the sound of lofi music being played softly along with it, and pencil writing effects. The audio should feel immersive and natural, ideal for a study-focus app."
```

**Likely output:** Layered, detailed study-focus music with rain behind along with lofi music and pencil writing sound effects.<br>
**Output:**
<video controls src="20241120-1652-01.7746535.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

**D. Multimodal Inputs, Combine text with audio references:**<br><br>
Example: 
```
"Generate a cinematic orchestral piece inspired by this 10-second melody (attached). Focus on string instruments and maintain a heroic tone."
```

**Output:** A soft xylophonic-orchestral arrangement inspired by the reference audio with the post-climax build-up.<br>

<br>

### 3. Advanced Techniques
**A. Iterative Prompting**<br><br>
- Start with a broad prompt, refine after initial output.
- Prompt 1: ```"Generate a 30-second simple jazz tune."```<br>
<video controls src="20241120-1711-17.0073022.mp4" title="Title"></video><br>

- Prompt 2: ```"feature a saxophone solo and double bass accompaniment."```<br>
<video controls src="20241120-1715-39.3283417.mp4" title="Title"></video>

- **Outcome:** The initial prompt seemed generic, but the layering of saxophone and double bass features created a perfect jazz-snippet with more fine-tuned details.<br><br>

**B. Parameter Tweaking**
- Adjust attributes like:
    - **Volume:** "Create soft background music."
    - **Tempo:** "Set the tempo to 120 BPM."
- Prompt :``` create a soft background music, keep the genre as lofi and set the tempo to 80BPM.```<br>
<video controls src="20241120-1720-35.7184973.mp4" title="Title"></video>

- **Outcome:** Providing parameter adjustment gave more emphasis to the genre, tempo, and volume, giving a more significant 

**C. Multi-Language or Accent Variations**
- Prompt: ```"Generate a French-accented male voice speaking in English."```
<video controls src="20241120-1757-33.3037004.mp4" title="Title"></video>
<br>

- **Outcome**: The generated text gave two different options
    - Opt 1: Use a male french voice over text which makes the french-accented English Voice
    - Opt 2: Generate french accented text on a British male voice to mimic a french-accented english audio.
    - *the output used the option one prompt* 

## Conclusion
Exploring various prompting techniques for AI audio generation reveals that specificity, iterative refinement, and understanding tool capabilities are crucial. By experimenting with detailed prompts and multimodal inputs, you can create tailored outputs for diverse use cases such as music production, sound design, and speech synthesis.
